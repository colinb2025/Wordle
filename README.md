# Wordle
Using Java's JavaFX, a front-end library, I was able to recreate the front-end for the famous brain game, Wordle. This project interacts with a standard five-word dictionary, provides proper feedback based off of the guesses, and gives you the ability to play once again after winning or running out of guesses. I have included a video down below to provide some guidance if you decide to test it or quick viewing for others.
